human-motion-detection
======================

+ Detect simple human motion from video files, precompiled binary for windows is provided, including 6 basic videos from KTH dataset with training data.
+ The implementation is based on the SVM machine learning algorithm from OpenCV library.
+ The learning algorithm is not perfect, if not broken, the more it learns, the less accurate it gets. I'm well aware of my subpar math skill.

#### Prerequisites:
+ Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1
+ Some input video file, perfect sample is from KTH Dataset (http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/)
